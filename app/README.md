# PYTOPE GUI

## Running
1. `npm start` to start the React web server
2. `npm run sass` to start the SASS live compiler
3. Head over to `localhost:3000` in browser

## /src Folder Hierarchy
### components
Contains React components commonly reused throughout other components

### css
Contains all CSS compiled SASS files generated by the SASS compiler

### pages
Contains React components that are the highest level views/pages routed to by react-router

### SASS
- `--load-paths` specified with the `sass` command will be ignored by CRA webpack's sass-loader config; this means that all cases of `@use` in scss files will require using relative paths
  - React will throw an error if a relative path is not used
