# PYTOPE GUI

### Running
1. Open two terminal shells
1. `npm start` to start the React web server (first shell)
2. `npm run sass` to start the SASS live compiler (second shell)
3. Head over to `localhost:3000` in browser

### /src Folder Hierarchy
#### components
Contains React components commonly reused throughout other components

#### css
Contains all CSS compiled SASS files generated by the SASS compiler

#### pages
Contains React components that are the highest level views/pages routed to by react-router

#### utils
Contains utility files with JavaScript logic or SCSS @rules that are commonly reused throughout the project

#### slices
Contains Redux (RTK) slices with importable reducers and actions

### SASS
- `--load-paths` specified with the `sass` command will be ignored by CRA webpack's sass-loader config; this means that all cases of `@use` in scss files will require using relative paths
  - React will throw an error if a relative path is not used

### Google Fonts
