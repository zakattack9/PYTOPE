# PYTOPE GUI

### Running
1. Open two terminal shells
1. `npm start` to start the React web server (first shell)
2. `npm run sass` to start the SASS live compiler (second shell)
3. Head over to `localhost:3000` in browser

### /src Folder Hierarchy
#### components
Contains React components commonly reused throughout other components

#### css
Contains all CSS compiled SASS files generated by the SASS compiler

#### pages
Contains React components that are the highest level views/pages routed to by react-router

#### utils
Contains utility files with JavaScript logic or SCSS @rules that are commonly reused throughout the project

#### slices
Contains Redux (RTK) slices with importable reducers and actions

### Practices Followed
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) CSS methodology
- Create a TypeScript `interface` for each component's props
- Build only functional components that use React hooks to leverage lifecycle methods
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) for layout positioning and [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) for inline element layout
  - Use `position` sparingly
- SASS [parent](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector) and [placeholder](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/placeholder-selectors) selectors

### Things To Keep In Mind
- Because Package Mapper, Test Designer, and Test Runner are all mutually exclusive components, meaning only one can be mounted at a time, switching to any other interface will result in the current interface being unmounted; this consequently results in any components within the unmounted interface losing their state for any specified hooks (useState, useRef).
  - If a component must maintain its state after its encompassing interface is unmounted, consider using the Redux store to save any necessary values

### SASS
- `--load-paths` specified with the `sass` command will be ignored by CRA webpack's sass-loader config; this means that all cases of `@use` in scss files will require using relative paths
  - React will throw an error if a relative path is not used
